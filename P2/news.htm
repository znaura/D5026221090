        Starting at 20.30 pm, the concert begins with shots of lights with various color spectrums that color the sky. The audience’s footsteps began to move closer to the stage when Yovie & Nuno personnel entered the stage area. Nostalgic euphoria was formed when they played one of their flagship songs, Not as Handsome as Romeo.
